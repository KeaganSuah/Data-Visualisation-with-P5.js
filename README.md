# ðŸ“Š Data Visualisation Project

An interactive web-based collection of data visualisations exploring social, environmental, and economic trends through creative coding and visual storytelling. Built using JavaScript and the p5.js framework, this project transforms complex datasets into engaging, intuitive experiences.

## Overview

This project was developed as part of an academic coursework on data visualisation. It demonstrates how data can be effectively communicated through interactive and aesthetic design using browser-based technologies. Each visualisation highlights real-world patterns and insights through interactive and animated representations.

## Highlights

- Multiple data visualisations across various topics (Gender Pay Gap, Climate Change, Tech Diversity, etc.)
- Built entirely with JavaScript, p5.js, and Mappa.js
- Modular design using helper scripts for data management and gallery navigation
- Interactive and animated rendering of datasets
- Uses real datasets from multiple years and domains

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to merge data science with design, emphasizing the importance of storytelling in data interpretation. It demonstrates technical and creative skills in data handling, front-end logic, and visual communication using modern creative coding tools.

## Installation and Setup

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-visualisation.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd data-visualisation
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

For full functionality with local data loading, you can run a simple local server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Usage

Open the main page and explore the gallery interface to browse different visualisations.
Each visualisation runs independently and presents data using animations and interactivity.

Example topics include:

* Gender Pay Gap (1997â€“2017)
* Climate Change
* Tech Industry Diversity
* COVID-19 Impact
* Nutritional Data Trends
* Bankruptcy Statistics
